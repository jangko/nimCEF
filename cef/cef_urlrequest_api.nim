# from the browser process. Requests originating from the render process will
# receive the same handling as requests originating from Web content -- if the
# response contains Content-Disposition or Mime-Type header values that would
# not normally be rendered then the response may receive special handling
# inside the browser (for example_api, via the file download code path instead of
# the URL request code path). The |request| object will be marked as read-only
# after calling this function. In the browser process if |request_context| is
# NULL the global request context will be used. In the render process
# |request_context| must be NULL and the context associated with the current
# renderer process' browser will be used.
